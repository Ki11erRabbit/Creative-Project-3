    <h1>About the photographer</h1>

  <p>Ever since man figured out how to draw, we have figured out better ways to draw.
    I use the latest drawing tools to preserve a moment and memento of your past for
    you and your kids to enjoy. I have been taking photographs since I learned and
  understood what a photo is. And since then photography has been my passion wherever
I find myself in the world. I set up this website so that I may lend my passion to others.</p>
